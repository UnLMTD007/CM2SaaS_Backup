Qlik SaaS to Qlik SaaS Process (same or another tenant)
-
- QAA is good point to start from and to try it
- qlik-cli is better, you have more control over the export process
- qlik-cli supports switching user context (loop thu users shared their API keys)
- QAA vs qlik-cli conclusion





ATM we have no full backup options, other user's private content cannot be reached.
-

We can recommend the use of qlik-cli and QAA to backup current user and published objects.
-

	- To be able to catch all user’s private objects, they need to be impersonated -> each user needs an API key.
	- QAA can not loop through multiple API keys to impersonate.

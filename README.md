# CM2SaaS_Backup
 1. ATM we have no full backup options, other user's private content cannot be reached.
 2. We can recommend the use of qlik-cli and QAA to backup current user and published objects.
	 - QAA is good point to start from and to try it
	 - qlik-cli is better, you have more control over the export process
	 - qlik-cli supports switching user context (loop thu users shared their API keys)
	 - QAA vs qlik-cli conclusion
 3. Windows or other tools sceduling with qlik-cli
 4. We can put some info about backup from CM and restore into SaaS
